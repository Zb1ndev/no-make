# NOB--
A build tool named after [Tsoding's](https://github.com/tsoding) [nob](https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild) project. While this project's functionality 
has basically nothing to do with the way Tsoding's nob works, "nob" sounds funny and mine is way worse ( hence the decrement ).

## Instructions
- Define ``` Macros ``` with ``` # ``` : ``` #macro : macro content ```
- Define ``` Commands ``` with a simple key, value syntax ``` command : gcc main.c -o main ```
