# No Make
A horrific build tool named after not being Make.

## Instructions
- Define ` Macros ` with ` # ` : ` #macro : macro content `
- Define ` Commands ` with a simple key, value syntax ` command : gcc main.c -o main `

## Installation
- Linux : Run the build.sh and it should just build and copy to your ` bin ` directory automatically.
- Windows : This project is also not meant for windows ( thus the lack of an installer ), if you want to use it you'll have to build it then add it maunually. [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBHu3bGIBA)
