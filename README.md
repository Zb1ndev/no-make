# NOB--
A build tool named after [Tsoding's](https://github.com/tsoding) [nob](https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild) project. While this project's functionality has basically nothing to do with the way Tsoding's nob works, "nob" sounds funny and mine is way worse ( hence the decrement ). 

## Instructions
- Define ` Macros ` with ` # ` : ` #macro : macro content `
- Define ` Commands ` with a simple key, value syntax ` command : gcc main.c -o main `

## Installation
- Linux : Run the build.sh and it should just build and copy to your ` bin ` directory automatically.
- Windows : This project is also not meant for windows ( thus the lack of an installer ), if you want to use it you'll have to build it then add it maunually. [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBHu3bGIBA)
